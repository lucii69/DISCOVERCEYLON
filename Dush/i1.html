        The Grand Mosque of Kattankudy, locally known as the Al-Aqsa Grand Jumma Masjid, is a striking Islamic place of worship located in the coastal town of Kattankudy in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province. This mosque stands out for its unique and vibrant architectural design, featuring a bright gold dome atop an octagonal blue arcade that evokes the famous Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. The structure was inaugurated recently in December 2022 and has quickly become a central landmark for both worship and local cultural identity. 
        
    <br><br>
    Architecturally, the mosque blends traditional Islamic motifs with local influences, creating a visually impressive building that draws large crowds, especially for Friday prayers and during Ramadan, when thousands of worshippers gather across its multiple stories and surrounding courtyard. Its ornate exterior and symbolic design make it not only a spiritual center but also a notable point of interest in the region.
    <br><br>
    Beyond its religious function, the Grand Mosque of Kattankudy has had a meaningful social impact on the community. The site attracts visitors from far and wide, boosting local halal tourism and supporting nearby businesses. The mosque also serves as a symbol of unity and resilience for the Muslim population in the area, fostering a sense of pride and community cohesion in a region where Muslims form the majority.
